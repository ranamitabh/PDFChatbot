early life
cristiano ronaldo dos santos aveiro was born on 5 february 1985 in the são pedro parish of funchal, the capital of the portuguese island of madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of santo antónio.[10][11] he is the fourth and youngest child of maria dolores dos santos viveiros da aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[12][13] and josé dinis aveiro, a municipal gardener at the junta de freguesia of santo antónio and part-time kit man for football club andorinha.[14][15][16] his great-grandmother on his father's side, isabel da piedade, was from the island of são vicente, cape verde.[17] he has one older brother, hugo, and two older sisters, elma and liliana cátia "katia".[18] he was named after actor and u.s. president ronald reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[19] his mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure,[20][21] as abortions were illegal in portugal at that time.[22] ronaldo grew up in an impoverished roman catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[23]
as a child, ronaldo played for andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[24] where his father was the kit man,[14] and later spent two years with nacional. in 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with sporting cp, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[25] he subsequently moved from madeira to lisbon to join sporting cp's youth system.[25] by age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in escola eb2 de telheiras, his school in the telheiras area of lisbon, ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at sporting cp, leonel pontes,[26] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[27][28] with a troubled life as a student[29] and living in lisbon area away from his madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[30][31] while popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[27] one year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[32] ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[33] he was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[34] in 2021, cristiano ronaldo's mother, dolores aveiro, stated in an interview for sporting cp's official television channel (sporting tv) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.[35]

club career

at age 16, ronaldo was promoted from sporting's youth team by first-team manager lászló bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[36] he subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the b team and the first team, all within a single season.[25]
on 14 august 2002,[37] cristiano ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for a sporting cp's senior team, in a uefa champions league qualifying round at josé alvalade stadium against inter milan. he came on in the 58th[37] minute in place of toñito.[38][39]
as far as the portuguese football league system's competitions is concerned, sporting cp b was the 1st team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2–1 away loss against sport clube lusitânia on 1 september 2002, in a game for the segunda divisão b championship played in the azores.[40] on 29 september 2002, ronaldo made his debut in the primeira liga, playing for sporting cp's main team against braga, and on 7 october, he scored two goals against moreirense in their 3–0 win.[41] over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to liverpool manager gérard houllier and barcelona president joan laporta.[42] manager arsène wenger, who was interested in signing ronaldo, met with him at arsenal's stadium in november to discuss a possible transfer.[43]
manchester united manager alex ferguson was determined to acquire ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after sporting defeated united 3–1 at the inauguration of the estádio josé alvalade on 6 august 2003. initially, united had planned to sign ronaldo and loan him back to sporting for a year.[44] having been impressed by him, the united players urged ferguson to sign him. after the game, ferguson agreed to pay sporting £12.24 million[44] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[45] a decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, sporting honoured ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[46]

manchester united
2003–2007: development and breakthrough


"there have been a few players described as 'the new george best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."


—former manchester united player george best hails the 18-year-old cristiano ronaldo in 2003.[47]


ronaldo's move to manchester united was completed on 12 august 2003, too late for the 2003 fa community shield but in time for their game against bolton wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first portuguese player to sign for the club.[48] his transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in english football history.[49] although he requested the number 28, his number at sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such united players as george best, eric cantona and david beckham.[50] wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for ronaldo.[51] a key element in his development during his time in england proved to be ferguson, of whom he later said: "he's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[52]

ronaldo playing for manchester united against chelsea during the 2005–06 premier league season
ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over bolton wanderers in the premier league on 16 august 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for nicky butt.[53] his performance earned praise from best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[47] ronaldo scored his first goal for manchester united with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over portsmouth on 1 november.[54] three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[55] the last of which came against aston villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[56] ronaldo ended his first season in english football by scoring the opening goal in united's 3–0 win over millwall in the 2004 fa cup final, earning his first trophy.[57] bbc pundit alan hansen described him as the star of the final.[58] the british press had been critical of ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[59] but teammate gary neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[60]



"he has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. we still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. his feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."


—former bbc pundit alan hansen commenting on ronaldo after his first season.[58]


ronaldo scored united's 1,000th premier league goal on 29 october 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to middlesbrough.[61] a few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[62] at the start of 2005, ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against aston villa and scoring twice against rivals arsenal.[63][64] he played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 fa cup final against arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, united lost 5–4.[65] ronaldo won his second trophy in english football, the football league cup, after scoring the third goal in united's 4–0 final win over wigan athletic.[66]
during his third season in england, ronaldo was involved in several incidents. he had a one-match ban imposed on him by uefa for a "one-fingered gesture" towards benfica fans,[67] and was sent off in the manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking manchester city's former united player andy cole.[68] ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker ruud van nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[69] following the 2006 fifa world cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate wayne rooney was sent off,[70] ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[71] united denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[72]
although his world cup altercation with rooney resulted in ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[73] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first premier league title. an important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach rené meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[74] he scored three consecutive braces at the end of december, against aston villa (a win that put united on top of the league), wigan and reading.[75][76][77] ronaldo was named the premier league player of the month in november and december, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[78]

2007–2008: collective and individual success
ronaldo playing for manchester united during the 2006–07 premier league season
at the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 uefa champions league, ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[79] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over roma.[80] he subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[81] but was marked out of the second leg as united lost 3–0 at the san siro.[82] he also helped united reach the 2007 fa cup final, but the final against chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[83] ronaldo scored the only goal in the manchester derby on 5 may (his 50th goal for the club), as united won their first league title in four years.[84] as a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. he won the professional footballers' association's player's player, fans' player and young player of the year awards, as well as the football writers' association's footballer of the year award,[85][86] becoming the first player to win all four main pfa and fwa honours.[87] his wages were raised to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension.[88] ronaldo was named runner-up to kaká for the 2007 ballon d'or,[89] and came third, behind kaká and lionel messi, in the running for the 2007 fifa world player of the year award.[90]
ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for united in a 6–0 win against newcastle united on 12 january 2008, which put united top of the league table.[91] on 19 march, he captained united for the first time in a home win over bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[92] his second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing george best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[93] his 31 league goals earned him the premier league golden boot,[94] as well as the european golden shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[95] he additionally received the pfa players' player of the year and fwa footballer of the year awards for the second consecutive season.[96][97] in the knockout stage of the champions league, ronaldo scored the decisive goal against lyon to help united advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate;[98] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over roma.[99] united reached the final against chelsea in moscow on 21 may, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[100] united emerged victorious 1–1, winning the penalties 6–5.[101][102] as the champions league top scorer, ronaldo was named the uefa club footballer of the year.[103]
ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in england. he missed three matches after headbutting a portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[104] as rumours circulated of ronaldo's interest in moving to real madrid, united filed a tampering complaint with governing body fifa over madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[105] fifa president sepp blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery".[106] despite ronaldo publicly agreeing with blatter,[107] he remained at united for another year.[108]

2008–2009: ballon d'or and continued success
ronaldo in 2009 with manchester united playing in a premier league game against liverpool
ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 july, ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[109] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[110] following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for united with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against stoke city on 15 november,[111] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the premier league at the time.[112] at the close of 2008, ronaldo helped united win the 2008 fifa club world cup in japan,[113] assisting the final-winning goal against liga de quito and winning the silver ball in the process.[114] with his 2008 ballon d'or and 2008 fifa world player of the year, ronaldo became united's first ballon d'or winner since best in 1968,[115] and the first premier league player to be named the fifa world player of the year.[116]
his match-winning goal in the second leg against porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural fifa puskás award, presented by fifa in recognition of the best goal of the year;[117] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[118] united advanced to the final in rome,[119] where he made little impact in united's 2–0 defeat to barcelona.[120] ronaldo ended his time in england with nine trophies, as united claimed their third successive league title and a football league cup.[121][122] he finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[123] his final goal for united came on 10 may 2009 with a free kick in the manchester derby at old trafford.[124]

real madrid
as his usual number 7 was unavailable, ronaldo wore number 9 during his debut season at madrid. after raúl departed the club, ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt before the 2010–11 season.
ahead of the 2009–10 season, ronaldo joined real madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million).[125] his contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[126] at least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the santiago bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed diego maradona at napoli.[127] since club captain raúl already wore the number 7 (the number ronaldo wore at united), ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[128] which was presented to him by former madrid player alfredo di stéfano.[129]

his strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. these attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[483][484][485] allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. he has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[478][483]
in his final seasons at united, ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[483] he developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[483] an accurate penalty kick taker,[486] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[487] when taking free kicks, ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by juninho pernambucano.[488] he also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[489] regarding ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former united assistant manager mike phelan commented: "people used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. he brought in a more dynamic showmanship. he places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. he is the ultimate showman. he has that slight arrogance. when he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'all eyes on me' and this is going in. he understands the marketing side of it. the way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him."[490]

as ronaldo entered his thirties he began to dribble less.[491]
at real madrid, ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[492] initially deployed as a centre forward by managers manuel pellegrini and josé mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[492][493][494] madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. while he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[495][496][497] this unique role has been described by pundits as that of a "false", "attacking", or "goalscoring winger", as ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[493][498] from 2013 onwards, under manager carlo ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[492][499][500] since 2017, ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager zinedine zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[501][502][503]
in his first season at juventus, ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager massimiliano allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. while he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at real madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with mario mandžukić. in this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with real madrid. off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[504][505] on occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[506][507][508] he continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager maurizio sarri.[505]

"in the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. now you see the complete player. his decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player."


—former manager alex ferguson, january 2013[509]


ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside lionel messi.[510] winning his first ballon d'or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[511] acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[512] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[513] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[514]

ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[515][516] on his longevity and "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", adam bate of sky sports said: "dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game."[491] while stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former brazil international ronaldo praised cristiano's approach to training, arguing that "there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. i trained because i had to, he does it because he loves it."[517] his drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as pelé and diego maradona once retiring.[518] he is credited, along with his compatriot, coach josé mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[519] at times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[520] he was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager alex ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[521] jonathan wilson of the guardian opined that ronaldo had made juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to "his relative immobility" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[522]
during his career, ronaldo has also been described as having an "arrogant image" on the pitch,[523] with ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[524] he is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[523] with ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[524] his managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[525][526][527]

goal celebrations
ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[528][529][530] after scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion"[529] into his "signature power stance",[530] while usually simultaneously exclaiming "sí" (spanish and italian for "yes").[528][531] this trademark celebration has been dubbed the "siu" in the media.[528][529][532]

rivalry with lionel messi
main article: messi–ronaldo rivalry
ronaldo with lionel messi before an international friendly between portugal and argentina in 2011
both ronaldo and lionel messi have scored in multiple uefa champions league finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[533] it has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the muhammad ali–joe frazier rivalry in boxing, the borg–mcenroe rivalry in tennis and the senna–prost rivalry from formula one motor racing.[534][535] some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[536] part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[537][538][539]



"it's part of my life now. people are bound to compare us. he tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as i do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."


—ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with messi.[540]


in a 2012 interview, ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "i think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."[541] alex ferguson, ronaldo's manager during his time at manchester united, opined: "i don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. i think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best."[542] messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but i've never fought with cristiano."[543] responding to the claims that he and messi do not get on well on a personal level, ronaldo commented: "we don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players." ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: "we have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."[540] representing archrivals barcelona and real madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, el clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[544]
in a debate at oxford union in october 2013, when asked whether fifa president sepp blatter preferred messi or ronaldo, blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the argentine before taking a swipe at ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other." real madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. in response to blatter's "commander" on the pitch comment, ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against sevilla.[545] in august 2019, ronaldo and messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the uefa men's player of the year, with ronaldo stating: "i pushed him and he pushed me as well. so it's good to be part of the history of football."[546]
in september 2023, ronaldo declared that his rivalry with messi was over and "gone", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".[547] after messi led argentina to victory in the 2022 fifa world cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that messi has settled the debate between the two players.[548][549][550]

^ varies between 1.85 and 1.89 by source. fifa and sports illustrated give 1.85,[2][3] luca caioli [es; fi] 1.86,[4] soccerway and eurosport 1.87,[5] premier league 1.87,[6] and the portuguese football federation 1.89.[7]

^ although there was no third-place playoff, both losing semi-finalists (germany and portugal) were awarded bronze medals by uefa.[8]

^ the terminology for the award has varied. ronaldo received three ballons d'or as awarded by france football magazine (2008, 2016, 2017) and two fifa ballons d'or (2013, 2014) as well as the 2008 fifa world player of the year and 2016 and 2017 best fifa men's player awards.

^ real madrid had previously recognised ronaldo as their all-time top scorer after he scored a brace against malmö ff on 30 september 2015. the club's official record book attributes to ronaldo a 74th-minute goal in a 2–1 win over real sociedad on 18 september 2010, despite his free-kick having been deflected by pepe.[208]
